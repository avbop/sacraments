# Scope
This project will provide an easy to use form that will assist a clerical user to collect and sort the information necessary to:
1. determine whether a person is ready to receive one or more of the sacraments of initiation;
2. obtain any necessary faculties to licitly administer said sacraments; and
3. ensure that the sacraments of initiation have been properly recorded.

This project is limited to the sacraments of initiation in the Latin Church.
The user will be instructed to turn to his local chancery for this information as it relates to matrimony.
As time and effort allow, the project may be extended to briefly propose ideas regarding recording the other sacraments or matters related to the Eastern Churches.

# Principles
1. Maintain strict privacy of users and information they submit.
    - This project will never receive nor store any personal information in any place other than the HTML input fields.
    - Once the page is fully loaded, no code will contact any remote server.
    - To prevent accidental sharing of information on shared computers, this page will use features to discourage browsers from saving input information, and it will not use any long-term user-side storage features (cookies, etc).
    - This project will not use any kind of tracking mechanism, and it will not use libraries hosted on third-party servers.
    - It is acknowledged that this emphasis on privacy will decrease the ease of use of the project, but saving the few minutes needed to re-enter data is less important than protecting the privacy of the people of God.
2. Focus on in-person interactions.
    - The form will be designed such that its intended user is a cleric preparing someone to receive the sacraments.
    - The form will always be in a condition that prints to a well-designed paper copy that is easy to use and aesthetically pleasing. This will be the case even if the form is incomplete, so that the cleric can collect information during a conversation with the recipient of the sacraments and later return to the digital form to complete it.
    - The intention of this project is that the cleric will use it before or after meeting with a person, not during that meeting. Likewise, the design of the project should discourage a cleric from sending someone else to use it. It is acknowledged that enforcing such behaviour is impossible, but the design of the project will make no consideration for these other use cases, and design decisions will favour this preferred use case wherever possible.
3. Adhere to the Code of Canon Law.
    - This project will address all and only the elements described in the Code of Canon Law. It will not take into account particular law.
    - In cases where interpretation is necessary, this project will apply the safest interpretation of the law and provide a more detailed explanation in a note.
    - This project will include citations to the relevant canons. These citations will be formatted in a way that is easy to find for an interested user but otherwise unobtrusive.
