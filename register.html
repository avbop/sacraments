                See also CCEO canon 35.
                Note that a person, once ascribed to a Church, cannot cease to be ascribed.
                For example, someone who was baptised Eastern Orthodox but now considers himself to be Protestant is still considered to be ascribed to the Eastern Orthodox Church in which he was baptised.
                Similarly, someone who has once been ascribed to any Catholic Church <span class="latin">sui iuris</span> can never change ascription to a non-Catholic Church.
                <br/>
                Canon 112 §1 3°. Children under the age of fourteen automatically change ascription following their parents.
                This is generally held to apply also to children whose parents come into the full communion of the Catholic Church.

                Baptism conferred outside the Catholic Church is often valid, if it is done by the washing of water and using the proper Trinitarian formula (see canons 849 and 845).<br/>
                The Catholic Church recognises the validity of the sacrament of confirmation as conferred by most Eastern non-Catholic Churches (see canons 882 and 845). Likewise, the Church recognises that any validly-ordained priest, even a non-Catholic priest, can validly confect the Most Holy Eucharist (see canon 844 §2).</br>

                <abbr title="Ordo initiationis christianae adultorum">OICA</abbr>, App., n. 13, explicitly requires only the person's name, date of baptism, and place of baptism.
                The requirement to record information regarding the act of reception into full communion is implicit.
                Canon 535 §2 requires recording of ascription to a Church <span class="latin">sui iuris</span>, confirmation, marriage, and other changes to a person's canonical status.
                <br/>
                By analogy to the baptismal register, it seems that additional information to identify the person may be useful (canons 535 §2 and 877).
                For example, particular law for the United States of America requires additionally: date of birth; place of birth; name of the minister; names of the parents; and names of the sponsors (National Statutes for the Christian Initiation of Adults, n. 16 §2).
