                Baptism conferred outside the Catholic Church is often valid, if it is done by the washing of water and using the proper Trinitarian formula (see canons 849 and 845).<br/>
                The Catholic Church recognises the validity of the sacrament of confirmation as conferred by most Eastern non-Catholic Churches (see canons 882 and 845). Likewise, the Church recognises that any validly-ordained priest, even a non-Catholic priest, can validly confect the Most Holy Eucharist (see canon 844 §2).</br>

                Canons 111 and 112.
                See also CCEO canon 35.
                Note that a person, once ascribed to a Church, cannot cease to be ascribed.
                For example, someone who was baptised Eastern Orthodox but now considers himself to be Protestant is still considered to be ascribed to the Eastern Orthodox Church in which he was baptised.
                Similarly, someone who has once been ascribed to any Catholic Church <span class="latin">sui iuris</span> can never change ascription to a non-Catholic Church.
                <br/>
                Canon 112 §1 3°. Children under the age of fourteen automatically change ascription following their parents.
                This is generally held to apply also to children whose parents come into the full communion of the Catholic Church.

            The law is unclear about whether a child between the ages of seven and eighteen should be received into full communion through a formal rite.
            If the child's parents have been received into full communion after the baptism of the child and before the child's fourteenth birthday, then it is commonly held that the child has been received into full communion by his or her parents' act.
            If the child's parents are not Catholic, careful pastoral discernment is needed.
            <br/>
            The confirmation of a child received into full communion may be delayed to a later time, if appropriate.
