            <aside>
                Baptism conferred outside the Catholic Church is often valid, if it is done by the washing of water and using the proper Trinitarian formula (see canons 849 and 845).<br/>
                The Catholic Church recognises the validity of the sacrament of confirmation as conferred by most Eastern non-Catholic Churches (see canons 882 and 845). Likewise, the Church recognises that any validly-ordained priest, even a non-Catholic priest, can validly confect the Most Holy Eucharist (see canon 844 §2).</br>
                In cases of uncertainty, consult a canonist.
